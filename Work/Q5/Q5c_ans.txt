1 Build the containers
    The Python container should be built using Dockerfile
    The Java container should be built using Dockerfile.java

2 Run the Python container
    The Python container should be executed to generate images and save them in a shared directory such as Work/Q5

3 Wait for the images to be created
    To ensure that images are generated before Java processes them,
    add a short delay using sleep 3 or check if the directory contains files using ls -1

4 Run the Java container
    After the images are created, run the Java container with environment variables for student names and IDs
    Ensure the watermarking process runs correctly and saves the processed images in Work/Q5/watermark_images
