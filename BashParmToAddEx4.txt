We think that we need to add the following parameters to BASH according to the exercise data:
    1. Getting a customized path to the CSV file instead of automatically searching the project.
    2. Option to choose a custom path to save the Diagrams folder.
    3. Setting the level of logs to be printed (info = only success messages, error = only errors, debug = all details).
    4. Option to create an automatic backup of the Diagrams folder after each run.
According to the instructions, we will implement these parameters according to the flag method so that there is a key flag followed by value

we will run the project like this:
./ex4.sh --path /root/LINUX_Course_Project/DOWNLOADS/LINUX_COURSE_WORK-downloads/plants.csv \
         --output-dir /root/LINUX_Course_Project/Work/Q4/Diagrams \
         --log-level debug \
         --backup yes \
         --temp-dir /tmp/workdir \
         --reuse-venv \
         --silent
